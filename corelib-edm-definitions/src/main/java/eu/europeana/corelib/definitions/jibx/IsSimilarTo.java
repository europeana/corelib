/** 
 * Definition The most generic derivation property, covering also the case
 of questionable derivation. Is Similar To asserts that parts of the contents of one
 resource exhibit common features with respect to ideas, shapes, structures, colors,
 words, plots, topics with the contents of the related resource. Those common
 features may be attributed to a common origin or influence (in particular for
 derivation), but also to more generic cultural or psychological factors.
