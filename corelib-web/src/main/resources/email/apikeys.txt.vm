Dear ${apiKey.firstName} ${apiKey.lastName},

Thank you for registering for the Europeana API. These are your Europeana API keys:

==========
API key      : ${apiKey.id}
Private key  : ${apiKey.privateKey}
==========

Please keep a safe record of these keys.
The API key is used in all API calls, including the core search and record methods. This key does not need to be kept confidential.
The private key is used for specific methods that require additional user authentication. It must be kept confidential and must not be exposed in user interfaces or in markup.

Our technical documentation is available at http://labs.europeana.eu/api/ including an API console for testing the API, and community developed libraries for a variety of programming languages.

Please join us in the Europeana API Forum - https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/europeanaapi - to ask questions to us and other developers and to give us your feedback on our API. You can also contact us directly by mailing api@europeana.eu and we'd be especially grateful if you would let us know about your implementation so that we can feature it in our application gallery on Europeana Labs - http://labs.europeana.eu/apps

Best regards,
The Europeana API Team
